Consider what you know about your buyer personas and their interests while you're coming up with a topic for your blog post.</p><p>For instance, if your readers are millennials looking to start a business, you probably don't need to provide them with information about getting started on social media — most of them already have that down.</p><p>You might, however, want to give them information about how to adjust their social media approach (for example — from what may be a casual, personal approach to a more business-savvy, networking-focused approach). That kind of tweak is what helps you publish content about the topics your audience really wants and needs.</p><p>Don't have buyer personas in place for your business?

Check out your competition.</strong></h3><p>What better way to draw inspiration than to look at your well-established competition?</p><p>It’s worth taking a look at popular, highly reviewed blogs because their strategy and execution is what got them to grow in credibility. The purpose of doing this isn’t to copy these elements, but to gain better insight into what readers appreciate in a quality blog.</p><p>There are multiple angles you should look at when doing a competitive analysis:</p><ul><li>Visuals: Look at the blog’s branding, color palette, and theme.</li><li>Copy: Analyze the tone and writing style of the competition to see what readers respond well to.</li><li>Topics: See what subject matter&nbsp;their readers enjoy interacting with.</li></ul><h3><strong>3. Determine what topics you’ll cover.</strong></h3><p>Before you write anything, pick a topic you’d like to write about. The topic can be pretty general to start as you find your desired&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderjar.com/blog-niche/?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">niche in blogging</a>.</p><p>Some ways to choose topics to cover include asking yourself questions like:</p><ul><li><em>Who do I want to write to?</em></li><li><em>How well do I understand this topic?</em></li><li><em>Is this topic relevant?</em></li></ul><h3><strong>4. Identify your unique angle.</strong></h3><p>What perspective do you bring that makes you stand out from the crowd? This is key to determining the trajectory of your blog’s future and there’s many avenues to choose in the process.</p><ul><li>What unique experience makes you a trusted expert or thought leader on the topic?</li><li>What problem will you solve for readers?</li><li>Will you share your opinions on trending debates?</li><li>Teach your readers how to do something?</li><li>Compare or share original research?</li></ul><p>It’s up to you to decide the unique angle you’ll take on topics.</p><h3><strong>5.

The name between the two periods is up to you, as long as this domain name doesn't yet exist on the internet.</p><p>Want to create a subdomain for your blog? If you already own a cooking business at www.yourcompany.com, you might create a blog that looks like this: blog.yourcompany.com. In other words, your blog's subdomain will live in its own section of yourcompany.com.</p><p>Some CMS platforms offer subdomains as a free service, where your blog lives on the CMS, rather than your business's website. For example, it might look like this: yourblog.contentmanagementsystem.com.

Your blog's \"About\" section is an extension of this higher-level statement. Think of it as your blog's mission statement, which serves to support your company's goals.</li></ul><h3><strong>9. Write your first blog post.</strong></h3><p>Once you have your blog set up, the only thing missing is the content. While the design and layout are fun and functionally necessary, it's the content that will draw your readers in and keep them coming back. So how do you actually go about writing one of these engaging and informational pieces?</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oa5E1LWHG7A?showinfo=0\"></iframe><p><br></p><h2>Writing Your First Blog Post</h2><p>You’ve got the technical and practical tidbits down — now it’s time to write your very first blog post. And nope, this isn’t the space to introduce yourself and your new blog (i.e. “Welcome to my blog! This is the topic I’ll be covering. Here are my social media handles. Will you please follow?”).</p><p>Start with “low-hanging fruit,” writing about a highly specific topic that serves a small segment of your target audience.</p><p>That seems unintuitive, right? If more people are searching for a term or a topic, that should mean more readers for you.</p><p>But that’s not true. If you choose a general and highly searched topic that’s been covered by major competitors or more established brands, it’s unlikely that your post will rank on the first page of search engine results pages (SERPs). Give your newly born blog a chance by choosing a topic that few bloggers have written about.</p><p>Let’s walk through this process.</p><h3><strong>1. Choose a topic you’re passionate and knowledgeable about.</strong></h3><p>Before you write anything, pick a topic for your blog post. The topic can be pretty general to start. For example, if you're a company that sells a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&amp;hubs_post-cta=CRM%20for%20small-to-enterprise%20businesses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">CRM for small-to-enterprise businesses</a>, your post might be about the importance of using a single software to keep your marketing, sales, and service teams aligned.</p><p>Pro tip: You may not want to jump into a \"how-to\" article for your first blog post.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Your credibility hasn’t been established yet. Before teaching others how to do something, you’ll first want to show that you’re a leader in your field and an authoritative source.</p><p>For instance, if you're a plumber writing your first post, you won’t yet write a post titled “How to Replace the Piping System in your Bathroom.” First, you'd write about modern faucet setups, or tell a particular success story you had rescuing a faucet before it flooded a customer's house.</p><p>Here are four other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?_ga=2.19944184.1115648469.1587910754-1675356138.1572978608&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&amp;hubs_post-cta=types%20of%20blog%20posts&amp;hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&amp;hubs_signup-cta=types%20of%20blog%20posts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">types of blog posts</a>&nbsp;you could start with:</p><ul><li>List (\"Listicle\"): 5 ways to fix a leaky faucet</li><li>Curated Collection: 10 faucet and sink brands to consider today</li><li>SlideShare Presentation: 5 types of faucets to replace your old one (with pictures)</li><li>News Piece: New study shows X% of people don't replace their faucet frequently enough</li></ul><p>If you're having trouble coming up with topic ideas, a good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-post-topic-brainstorm?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">topic brainstorming session</a>&nbsp;should help.

See what your first blog post can look like based on the topic you choose and the audience you're targeting.</p><h3><strong>2. Target a low-volume keyword to optimize around.</strong></h3><p>Finding a keyword with low searches in Google (we recommend sticking to about 10 to 150 monthly searches). These topics offer less competition and should therefore allow your new blog post to rank more easily.</p><p>To choose a topic, you can either do a traditional brainstorming session or carry out keyword research. We suggest the latter because you can actually see how many people are looking for that topic.</p><p>Now, don’t be intimidated by the term “<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">keyword research</a>.” It’s not just for marketers, but for new bloggers, too. And it’s really easy to do.</p><p>To jumpstart your keyword research, first begin by identifying the general topic of your blog.</p><p>Say you’re a plumber. Your general, high-level topic might be “plumbing” (67K monthly searches).</p><p>Next, put this term into a keyword research tool such as:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Ahrefs</a></li><li><a href=\"https://moz.com/explorer?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Moz</a></li><li><a href=\"https://app.neilpatel.com/?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Ubersuggest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.wordtracker.com/?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Wordtracker</a></li></ul><p>When you run this term through the tool, a list of related keywords will appear. Scan the list and choose one with a lower search volume. For this example, we’ll use “under sink plumbing” (1.4K monthly searches).</p><p>Run that keyword in the keyword research tool again. Look at the related keywords. Find one with a lower search volume. Do that again.</p><p>For this example, we’ll settle on “plumbing problems under kitchen sink” (10 monthly searches). That’s the topic for our first post.</p><p>TLDR; Choose a low-volume, low-competition keyword that will ensure your first post ranks.</p><p>For more help on keyword research, here are more resources you can use:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">How to Do Keyword Research for SEO: A Beginner's Guide</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-rank-hubspot-seo-strategist?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">How to Perform Keyword Research and Rank</a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-tools-to-find-long-tail-keywords?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Top Tools For Finding Long-Tail Keywords</a></li></ul><h3><strong>3. Google the term to understand your audience’s search intent.</strong></h3><p>You’ve got your topic — now, you need to check that the user’s search intent would be fulfilled by a blog post.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>If someone is looking for “plumbing problems under a kitchen sink,” they might be looking for a tutorial, a diagram, an article, or a product that can fix the issue. If they’re looking for the first three, you’re good — that can be covered in a blog post. A product, however, is different, and your blog post won’t rank.</p><p>How do you double-check search intent?</p><p>Google the term and look at the results. If other articles and blog posts rank for that term, you’re good to go. If you only find product pages or listicles from major publications, then find a new topic to cover in your first post.</p><p>Consider the term “under sink plumbing bathroom” (30 monthly searches). It seemed like a perfect fit because it had low monthly searches.</p><p>Upon Googling the term, we found product carousels, product pages from Home Depot and Lowes, and guides written by major publications. (You’ll also want to avoid topics that have been covered by major publications, at least for now.)</p><p>TLDR; Before writing your first blog post about a low-volume topic, double-check the user intent by Googling the keyword. Also, don’t forget to take a look at who’s written about that topic so far. If you see a major brand, consider writing about another topic.</p><h3><strong>4. Find questions and terms related to that topic.</strong></h3><p>You’ve got a highly unique topic that’s been covered by just a few people so far. It’s time to flesh it out by covering related or adjacent topics.</p><p>Use the following tools:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://answerthepublic.com/?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Answer the Public</a>: When you place your keyword into this tool, it will give you a list of questions related to that term.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.google.com/?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">Google</a>: Google is your best friend. Search for the term and look under “People also ask” and “People also search for.” Be sure to touch upon those topics in the post.</li></ul><p>You can also use these keyword research tools we mentioned above in step one.</p><h3><strong>5. Come up with a working title.</strong></h3><p>You might come up with a few different working titles — in other words, iterations of approaching that topic to help you focus your writing.</p><p>For example, you may decide to narrow your topic to \"Tools for Fixing Leaky Faucets\" or \"Common Causes of Leaky Faucets.\" A working title is specific and will guide your post so you can start writing.</p><p>Let's take a real post as an example: \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-choose-solid-topic-next-blog-post-ht?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post</a>.\"</p><p>Appropriate, right? The topic, in this case, was probably \"blogging.\" Then the working title may have been something like, \"The Process for Selecting a Blog Post Topic.\" And the final title ended up being \"How to Choose a Solid Topic for Your Next Blog Post.\"</p><p>See that evolution from topic, to working title, to final title? Even though the working title may not end up being the final title (more on that in a moment), it still provides enough information so you can focus your blog post on something more specific than a generic, overwhelming topic.</p><h3><strong>6. Create an outline.</strong></h3><p>Sometimes, blog posts can have an overwhelming amount of information — for the reader and the writer. The trick is to organize the info in a way so readers aren't intimidated by length or amount of content. This organization can take multiple forms — sections, lists, tips — whatever's most appropriate. But it must be organized!<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/p3dqX5z/Blog-Post-Template.webp\"></p><p>Let's take a look at the post, \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-use-snapchat-for-business?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">How to Use Snapchat: A Detailed Look Into HubSpot’s Snapchat Strategy.</a>\" There's a lot of content in the piece, so it's broken up into a few sections using descriptive headers. The major sections are separated into subsections that go into more detail, making the content easier to read.</p><p>To complete this step, all you really need to do is outline your post. This way, before you start writing, you'll know which points you want to cover and the best order to do so. And to make things even easier, you can<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/blog-post-templates?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&amp;hubs_post-cta=download%20and%20use%20our%20free%20blog%20post%20templates&amp;hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog&amp;hubs_signup-cta=%20download%20and%20use%20our%20free%20blog%20post%20templates\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">&nbsp;download and use our free blog post templates</a>, which are pre-organized for six of the most common blogs.

Write an intro (and make it captivating).</strong></h3><p>We've written more specifically about writing captivating introductions in the post \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-introduction-quick-tip-ht?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">How to Write an Introduction</a>,\" but let's review, shall we?</p><p>First, grab the reader's attention. If you lose the reader in the first few paragraphs — or even sentences — of the introduction, they'll stop reading (even before they've given your post a fair shake). You can do this in a number of ways: tell a story or a joke, be empathetic, or grip the reader with an interesting fact or statistic.</p><p>Then, describe the purpose of your post and explain how it will address a problem the reader may be experiencing. This will give the reader a reason to continue reading and show them how the post will help them improve their work or lives.</p><p>Here's an example of an intro we think does a good job of attracting a reader's attention right away:</p><p><em>“Blink. Blink. Blink. It's the dreaded cursor-on-a-blank-screen experience that all writers — amateur or professional, aspiring or experienced — know and dread. And of all times for it to occur, it seems to plague us the most when trying to write an introduction.”</em></p><h3><strong>8. Build out each section of your outline.</strong></h3><p>The next step — but not the last — is actually writing the content. We can't forget about that, of course.</p><p>Now that you have your outline or template, you're ready to fill in the blanks. Use your outline as a guide and expand on all points as needed. Write about what you already know, and if necessary, conduct additional research to gather more information, examples, and data to back up your points, while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33098/How-Not-to-Steal-People-s-Content-on-the-Web.aspx?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(11, 132, 132);\">providing proper attribution</a>&nbsp;when incorporating external sources.
